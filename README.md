MarketPlace NFTs - Group Final Project 
It is an NFT Marketplace where you can buy, sell and create your own NFTs. You will be able to connect to a test blockchain network and operate in the app. You can also create a user and log in through your own or external registration system.
It has a connection to the Web3 through the Metamask wallet, if you do not have cryptocurrencies in the Metamask, through our recharge method you will be able to load it with any credit card.
It has real NFTS obtained from an external api, and NFTS created by ourselves. They can be filtered and sorted either by name or by category.

To carry out the project we use the Git Flow and apply Agile Methodologies (SCRUM).
